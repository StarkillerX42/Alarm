# Alarm Clock

This is my alarm clock for my raspberry pi. it works rather well with my setup, but you'll probably need to make some changes for implimentation on your own pi. for example, my music is stored on a USB called Shodan, which you'll need to change.

## Known Issues
The pi can run a little hot processing a wave file. pygame seems to br thr best music player, but it really taxes the CPU and runs just below 80deg C. If you can find a more lightweight method, feel free to pull request.
